# Motativation
This was apart of my "Understanding of OS theoretical concepts" and emulator series. I enjoy my time with this project, if you're interested in AMD virtualization then read chapter 15 of the amd manual.

## Credit - Special Thanks:
  Thanks to these OGs, for the spark of inspiration/support and just being good friends overall on my continuous effort on this project and for helping me understand certain concepts within HyperVisor development Journey. =)
  * [xeroxz](https://twitter.com/_xeroxz?lang=en) - Helping explain concepts around HV and allowing me to use his code semantics for his amazing Hypervisor project
  * [Daax](https://twitter.com/daax_rynd) - His big brain coming in clutch like always. He's given me a great layout on the semantics of a AMD HyperVisor and his approach on it, sharing resources left and right. Even answered my most trivial questions. Daax never misses
  * **horsie** - sharing some resource
  * [tandasat](https://github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm/)
  * [Irql0](https://github.com/irql0) - explaining certain Windows kernel driver, OS concepts and getting me out of tough assembly problems
  * [iPower](https://github.com/iPower) - sharing an approach to hooking System Calls
